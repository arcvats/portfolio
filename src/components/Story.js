            Hey, so you like reading. Amazing, I like that too, I can't have a
            day without reading something. As I was talking about being INTJ in
            the INTRO, so let me explain it in my terminology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting one alphabet at a time, "I" stands for{" "}
            <b>"Introversion"</b>, cool that is a big word, but actually its
            quite simple. You can consider my nature as <code>HTTP</code> where
            for every request you get a response otherwise nothing. "N" is the{" "}
            <b>"Intuition"</b>, which is what saves the most whenever a bug is
            encountered. "T" is the <b>"Thinking</b>", so my brain works like a{" "}
            <code>Kafka Queue</code>; highly distributed, highly scalable and
            works effortlessly with many requests. The last one is "J" which
            stands for <b>"Judgement"</b>, it is like{" "}
            <code>Elastic Search</code>, I can query my brain faster and can
            easily come up with a relevance score.
          </p>
          <p>
            Phew! That was a lot. If you are interested in finding your
            personality or want more details then you can visit 16personalities
            (it is free!!). You have shown a lot of patience my friend and you
            are a reader. Now, we can move on to my story and where it all
            started.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a nice summer evening, I was sitting in front of my computer
            and playing some first person shooting game when my uncle came home
            for dinner. I was 11 years at that time, and the only thing I knew
            about computers was crazy games and the paint application (I really
            loved drawing hut, sun, mountains and river). My uncle told me that
            he can print my name on the screen whatever number of times I
            wanted. I was curious. I told him that I want to see my name 10
            times. He said let's do it a 100 times and installed a blue screen
            application. He typed something in the blue window and Eureka!,
            there it was my name printed 100 times on a black screen. He later
            told me it was C language and the editor was{" "}
            <code>TurboC(Borland)</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got my inspiration, there he was "the programmer", "the hero",
            more like the <code>"!important"</code> in <code>CSS</code>. The
            next day I got myself a book on C programming. I struggled a lot
            with what was written and never got my way around it until sometime
            after. Having a hard time debugging, I finally went for a C language
            certification.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was an introductry C language course, but making star triangles
            on the screen and finding leap year was really cool. It was the
            first plunge and I dived deep into the technologies after that. I
            took programming as a subject in my Intermediate and went on to take
            admission in Computer Science undergraduate program.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my undergraduate, I started learning more languages, did
            freelancing, created some fun projects and dumped Windows for Linux.
            It was when I got introduced to <code>PHP</code> and{" "}
            <code>Javascript</code>. I remember sitting whole day reading about
            the language and trying to configure my new Linux machine with
            Apache server, PHP and MySQL. But life was easy after that, I could
            create web pages, see the data flow through the application. It was
            like Javascript without <code>this</code>. There was a problem
            though, I used to transfer source code using usb drive which was
            very inconvenient. It was when <code>GIT</code> came to the rescue.
            Everything went great until I read an article on MVC and design
            patterns which made me feel like I am standing on the
            <code>root</code> node of a large <code>tree</code>. With MVC came
            Rails in which the whole MVC example was given. Now, I fell in love
            with <code>Ruby</code> and <code>Rails</code>. It seemed like a
            match made in heaven. How could a language be so cool? This was when
            I learned about frameworks (What?, Why? and How?). My journey in
            college was with a lots of ups and downs but I always told myself
            that life is like a <code>singly linked list</code>, you can only go
            ahead and whatever gone is gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finishing my undergraduate, I went to work for a Payment
            Gateway. My first project was on AngularJS, which seemed really
            difficult with a large codebase. But thanks to my great team, who
            helped me in smooth transition. I learned most of the concepts of
            <code>AngularJS</code> by doing <code>TDD</code>(never had much fun
            writing unit tests). After some time and working on PHP, Node,
            Python and others; I became good at context switching (more like{" "}
            <code>paging</code> in an OS). I got to know if you ask your manager
            for a leave, and he says yes then it is like "
            <code>visibility:hidden</code>" in CSS. Also, if a person from
            testing team calls you, you feel like a{" "}
            <code>dangling pointer</code> (all hopes suddenly gone) and if
            something breaks then it is like <code>event bubbling</code> which
            goes around the whole organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            After one year, I left my job and worked as a Consultant with a
            budding startup. Then I came to Canada for post-graduation. During
            my post graduation I found a part time software engineer job where I
            did a lot of canvas, optimizations, monkey patching etc and whatever
            time was left, worked on learning something, solving problems and
            creating something cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, that was my story in short and here I am now after my post
            graduation, working, learning, talking to you and hoping to meet you
            some day when we can discuss about technologies and I can listen to
            your beautiful story.

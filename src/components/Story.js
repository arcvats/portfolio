            Hey, so you like reading. Amazing, I like that too, I can't have a
            day without reading something. As I was talking about being INTJ in
            the INTRO, so let me explain it in my terminology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting one alphabet at a time, "I" stands for "Introversion", cool
            that is a big word, but actually its quite simple. You can consider
            my nature as HTTP where for every request you get a response
            otherwise nothing. "N" is the "Intuition", which is what saves the
            most whenever a bug is encountered. "T" is the "Thinking", so my
            brain works like a Kafka Queue; highly distributed, highly scalable
            and works effortlessly with many requests. The last one is "J" which
            stands for "Judgement", it is like Elastic Search, I can query my
            brain faster and can easily come up with a relevance score.
          </p>
          <p>
            Phew! That was a lot. If you are interested in finding your
            personality or want more details then you can visit 16personalities
            (it is free!!). You have shown a lot of patience my friend and you
            are a reader. Now, we can move on to my story and where it all
            started.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a nice summer evening, I was sitting in front of my computer
            and playing some first person shooting game when my uncle came home
            for dinner. I was 11 years at that time, and the only thing I knew
            about computers was crazy games and the paint application (I really
            loved drawing hut, sun, mountains and river). My uncle told me that
            he can print my name on the screen whatever number of times I
            wanted. I was curious. I told him that I want to see my name 10
            times. He said let's do it a 100 times and installed a blue screen
            application. He typed something in the blue window and Eureka!,
            there it was my name printed 100 times on a black screen. He later
            told me it was C language and the editor was TurboC(Borland).
          </p>
          <p>
            I got my inspiration, there he was "the programmer", "the hero",
            more like the "!important" in CSS. The next day I got myself a book
            on C programming. I struggled a lot with what was written and never
            got way around it until sometime after. Having a hard time
            debugging, I finally went for a C language certification.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was an introductry C language course, but making star triangles
            on the screen and finding leap year was really cool. It was the
            first plunge and I dived deep into the technologies after that. I
            took programming as a subject in my Intermediate and went on to take
            admission in Computer Science undergraduate program.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my undergraduate, I started learning more languages, more
            technologies, did freelancing, created some fun projects and dumped
            Windows for Linux. It was the time when I got introduced to MVC,
            GIT, Open Source and a lot more.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finishing my undergraduate, I went to work for a Payment
            Gateway. Well, now I applied what I learned. I worked on different
            projects and solved really complex problems. Also, I got to know if
            you ask your manager for leave, and he says yes then it is like
            "visibility:hidden" in CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            After one year, I left my job worked as a Consultant and came to
            Canada for post-graduation. During my post graduate I found a part
            time software engineer job and whatever time was left, worked on
            learning new technologies, solving problems and creating something
            cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, here I am now after my post graduation, working, learning,
            talking to you and hoping to meet you some day when we can discuss
            about technologies and your beautiful story.

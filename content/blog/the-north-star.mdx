![The North Star](/blog/poetry/north_star.jpeg "Generated by DALL-E.")

###### *In the north, a star shines,*
###### *Brighter than the rest,*
###### *Within the gloom of darkness,*
###### *Leaving the light in jest.*

#

###### *Guiding sailors bold and strong,*
###### *Towards the unknown quest,*
###### *Of treasure known to no man,*
###### *Or of their own bequest.*

#


###### *It sees the tides high and low,*
###### *Engulfing some in haste or slow,*
###### *The one who lives to see its light,*
###### *It gives the hope to row.*

#


###### *It is the star that lived before,*
###### *The man who made the mast,*
###### *An egalitarian of light and hope,*
###### *Till the end will last.*

#


###### *Not the dark seas alone,*
###### *It watches over the lands,*
###### *Through the curious eyes unknown,*
###### *In the far north, it stands.*

#


###### *It has seen the fields of white,*
###### *Of green that turned to dust,*
###### *The man who shaped the future,*
###### *But lost a lot for lust.*

#


###### *Gleaming brightly for mighty those,*
###### *Who rise and build from dearth,*
###### *The liege of all the senses,*
###### *Who put their faith in earth.*

#


###### *Looking down in the hope of great,*
###### *As all the worldly shrines,*
###### *To bond them all in wisdom,*
###### *In the north, a star shines.*
